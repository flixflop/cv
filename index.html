                    <h3>Hacking</h3>
                    <p class="code-skill-desc">
                        I started my coding journey around 13 years old because I wanted to make my own games.
                        However, I couldn't get the C++ tutorial to work because I had no idea what the command line 
                        or the compiler was. So I gave up my passion for about a decade.<br>
                        During my undergraduate in physics the old spark reignited - mainly because it greatly helped
                        with analysing the data for the experimental physics labortory experiments.
                        Throughout my graduate program in applied and engineering physics I got much more exposure to 
                        a variety of usecases for programming including image and data processing, simulation and 
                        statistical analysis.
                        For my PhD I heavily relied on Python for data transformation, analysis and image generation (
                        a lot of which ended up in articles or my <a href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1634413">thesis</a>).
                        It was this journey (and my laziness) which made me realize how fun it can be to automate boring 
                        stuff with the computer.
                        Eventually, this turned into my day-to-day job which I am now doing as a risk manager and 
                        data analyst.
                        Nevertheless, I would describe myself more as a hacker than a coder or even software engineer.
